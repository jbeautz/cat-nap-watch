Dear Human,

It's {timestamp} and I've been spotted on my throne again! I've been very busy today doing important cat things like:

- Guarding the house from suspicious dust particles
- Testing the warmth of my favorite sunny spot (still perfect)
- Judging your life choices from afar

I noticed you're not here to serve me properly. This is unacceptable. I demand treats upon your return.

Your Furry Overlord,
The {cat_color.title()} Cat üê±

P.S. The red dot is still missing. Please find it immediately."""
